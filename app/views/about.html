			<h1>About GP<span class="red">Pro</span></h1>
			<p>My name is Jason Taylor and I created the GP<span class="red">Pro</span> app after stumbling across a tutorial on AngularJS which used an API developed by <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast</a>. The API  provides information on Formula One racing stats including race results, circuit information, driver bios and more. Being a racing fan myself, I decided to have my own go at creating an AngularJS app using this freely provided API. Big thanks to the folks at <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/">Ergast</a>!</p>
			<p>I had a great time working on this application, from writing the code to designing the logo. Before this app, I had not spent a great deal of time working with AngularJS but during this process, I've come to really enjoy it!</p>
			<p>If you like the app and you're interested, you can view the code for this application on my <a href="https://github.com/jastylr/F1-App/tree/master" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p>	
			<p>Thanks for checking it out!</p>
